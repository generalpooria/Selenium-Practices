# Learning Selenium and Pytest with Python

This project is a collection of exercises and tests that I created to learn Selenium and Pytest with Python.

The exercises are based on web scraping and testing web applications using Selenium and Pytest. They cover topics such as:

* Web scraping with Selenium
* Testing web applications with Pytest
* Using Page Objects to organize the tests more maintainable
* Using Parametrize to run tests with different inputs
* Using Fixtures to set up and tear down the test environment

The project also includes some notes and tips on how to use Selenium and Pytest effectively.

I hope that this project can be useful to others who are also learning Selenium and Pytest with Python.
